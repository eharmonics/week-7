    "Normalizing ratings can be advantageous as it allows for fairer comparisons between users and movies, as the ratings are adjusted based on the individual's scale of rating. Normalization can also help to reduce the impact of outlier ratings, by scaling them down to a more reasonable range.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, normalizing ratings can also have some disadvantages. For instance, it may not reflect the true preferences of the user as it scales their ratings to fit a normalized range. Additionally, normalization may not always produce meaningful results if the rating range of different users is not consistent, or if some users have only rated a few movies while others have rated many.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while normalizing ratings can help in fairer comparisons, it should be used with caution and not as a sole method of analysis. A combination of both normalized and actual ratings should be considered in order to gain a more accurate understanding of user preferences and movie ratings."
